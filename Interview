1) What is TLS FALLBACK SCSV used for :
Prevents attackers from downgrading TLS versions.
Helps enforce strong encryption.
Protects against POODLE and similar attacks.

2) Password hashing:
one way function ,fixed length string using cryptographic algorithm, password hashes are stored in DB insureing prevent password leak,
bcript, script , argon2, sha-256
some also use salting process

3) How can u recon a network:

4) Ftp port 21: nmap script, anonymous, version, brute-force 

5) Eternal blue ms17-010:
vulnerability with SMBv1.
due to improper handling of specially crafted SMB packets sent to the target. can lead to RCE.

6) Starttls

7) Weak Ciphers in Cryptography:
insecure due to outdated designs, small key sizes, or known vulnerabilities.
small key size can crack with morden GPUs.
e.g: MD5, SHA1,RC4, DES
attacks like POODLE

8) Can CBC ciphers used in TLS 1.2?
  They can be used but are avoided bcuz of considered weak,they have multiple vulnerabilities like poodle attack, etc.
Block of data are encrypted and are depend on pervious block.makes it suseptible to padding oracle attack like attacks.

9) TLS handshake :
   It happens whenever a secure connection is initiated between client and server using https, ftps, smpts n other TLS based protocols.
client - ( tls versions and ciphers) 
server -(selected tls and cipher)
server -(my digital certificate) clint verifies.
Key exchange - between both.
