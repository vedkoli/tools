--------------------------------------

Study Approach:

1. Start with Networking & Security Protocols (Understand TLS, SSL, and scanning techniques).


2. Move to Cryptography (Focus on encryption, hashing, and password security).


3. Study Web Application Security (OWASP Top 10 and common attacks).


4. Learn Thick Client & Reverse Engineering (Exe/DLL hijacking, traffic analysis).


5. Practice Security Tools (BurpSuite, Nmap, Scanners).


6. Understand System Security & Databases (OSI model, DBMS, and SQL Injection).
