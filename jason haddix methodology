1)open ports - defaults creds, service level exploits
2)web hosting software - possible login method,config file , bug associated to framework itself
3) Application frame work - same as aBove
4) Application  custom code or COTS : Custom modifications and pages added to framework as per compnay needs , where where SQL, IDOR, ETC WILL get
5) Appilcation Libraries ( usualy JS) associated vulnerabilites
5) Integartion : our application to other application comunication

------------PRE TESTING STUFF ---------------
[x] TECH PROFILING [ BROWSER EXTENTIONS ] : Wappalyzer , Whatruns

[x] Finding CVS's and Misconfigs : 
We need to analyze if target have - ( weakness reated to non-custom code)
Known vulnerabilities, Framework login pages, Default Creds, etc 
These are usually Platforms, Application server, Framework, CMS ,Library and misconfiguration
TOOLS : Nuclie , Sn1per , Jaeles scanner , react.js ,Gofinferprint , vulners, intrigue core

[x] Port scan : tool= naabu -host abc.com

---------CONTENT DISCOVERY ---------------
TOOLS: FEROXBUSTER , Turbo Intrufer , Gobuster, Fuff (contol respose filter code ), Wfuzz, Dirsearch.
Discovery list : image 
Keep in mind : everything you get 401 as response code  -> you should consider recursion
